# hello-world
This is a basic repository.

I am Brett Ferguson.  I attend Illinois Valley Central High School and I'm a Senior there.  I plan to attend Illinois Central Community College and then Monmouth College and major in Computer Science.

I love to cook, read fiction novels, write code, and play pc/phone games.

Last summer (2016) I worked at Shore Acres Pool in Chillicothe, IL, where I live.

I live with my Mom, Dad, Sister, and her cat.
